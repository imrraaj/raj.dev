Old thing when I first published a real paper. Keeping it here because I don't want to lose it.

- Introduction, paragraph 1 - please add example of gathered data - **examples added**

- Introduction, paragraph 3 - "and One- third of projects" - why one is capitalized? - **corrected**

- Introduction, paragraph 3 - please add reference to the claim - **citation added**

- Introduction - "...team[1] It is important ..." - missing dot - **corrected**

- Introduction - more references need to be added in this section, e.g. for different method of estimation - **citation added**

- Methods of efforts estimation would be better as a unnumbered list and not subsections since there is too little content for subsections. - **corrected**

- "Estimating is important in project management since it might result in poor project management, which could fail." - this sentence is unclear, project or management could fail? - **corrected**

- "Support Machine learning algorithms such as vector regression, regression algorithms such as simple linear regression..." - sentence unclear, why machine is capitalized? - **corrected**

- "However, We do wish to" - we should not be capitalized - **corrected**

- "To find substitutes, enhance existing models, or support existing models, several models have been created and built." - this sentence is unclear, maybe because to repetitions of word model - **corrected**

- Section 2.1. - remove semicolon from section title - **corrected**

- Check for missing spaces between text and references in the generated PDF - **corrected**

- "...terms of the month constant" - why constant? is it a good word here? - **corrected**

- In section 2.1 there are information about authors approach which should be in further sections, since this section is related work. - **corrected**

- Section 2.2 - first sentence is unclear, authors of which paper? The R2 is the best but in comparison to what? - **corrected**

- In Section 2 related work needs to be described more clearly. It is not clear where description of specific approaches start and end, and where authors comment on their own approach. There is no critical analysis that can give justification to the presented research. - **corrected**

- The goal of section 3 is unclear. It is should and references given are from different fields. Consider making this information part of Related work or extend this section to be more exaustive. - **corrected**

- The title of section 4 does not reflect the content. There is no methodology described but different ML methods. - **corrected**

- In section 4.2 title vector word and in section 4.3 forest word should be capitalized. - **corrected**

- In sections 4.2 and 4.4 the formulas and notation need to be explained or only reference to a publication with explaination needs to be given. - **citation already given in description for the models**

- "...enabling controlled One can build several decision trees using a variance..." - this part is unclear, please correct English - **corrected**

- "...predicts the error rate" - why predict? this needs to be reformulated - **corrected**

- "...general, Because they can..." - remove capitalization - **corrected**

- In table 5.1 column headers are unclear, e.g. positive integer. The content is unclear. Some rows seem to be merge. The capitalization of words is inconsistent. The content of Object Id column does not match the header name. - **corrected**

- "Integers make up about 70% of the utilized characteristics." - this is unclear, please give broader explaination. - **corrected**

- Section 5 should be extended. There is not enough explaination on the dataset and features that were considered. It is not clearly stated which methods were tested and how the results compared to results obtained in other work. What parameters were used for each method? - **corrected**

- Figure 5.3 should be explained - what is the meaning of the obtained results? - **corrected**

- "The results in the table demonstrate that the..." - which table? - **corrected**

- The resolution of the figures should be improved. Values on the axes are hard to read. - **corrected**

- In Figure 5.3 names on axes are not explained and mapped onto the dataset description. - **corrected**

- In conclusions it would be good to discuss how ML-based approach could be used in practice - by who? what data needs to be gathered? - **corrected**
